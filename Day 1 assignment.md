## Question 1:
## What is your understanding of Blockchain?
A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. ... By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".
## Question 2:
## What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?
#1. Cross-Border Payments
The Problem: The current state of international payments through banking channels is a hotch-potch, to say the least. It is a multistep process that involves a lot of intermediaries. Furthermore, each step of the process takes a lot of time and also requires a hefty amount of money. 

In fact, according to the World Bank, the average transaction fee for worldwide payments is around 7%. That’s a lot!

How Blockchain Solves The Problem: Blockchain helps streamline the entire process by cutting out any and all middlemen, and lengthy procedures, thereby the burden of unnecessary time delays.

By using its secure and sophisticated distributed ledger, once a transaction gets recorded, the payment is almost instantaneously transferred to the receiving party. Since the transaction can’t be reversed or changed, it also ensures better accountability and security than the currently employed system.

According to Deloitte, for transactions made using Blockchain, the involved parties incur around 40% to 80% less remittance fees than traditional methods. Not only that, but the entire transactions are processed and completed in a matter of 4 to 6 seconds instead of having to wait for days. 

And when you include the benefits of added security and transparency into the mix, Blockchain is surely a better solution for global monetary transactions.

Who Are Currently Using Blockchain For This Purpose: Currently, a bunch of fintech companies is using Blockchain to solve this problem. Notable names in the field include: 

Circle: Allows users to safely transfer money (multiple supported currencies) to over 29 countries.

Ripple: Helps banks, payment providers, and digital asset exchanges to send and receive money globally, super fast and with minimal remittance fees.

WeTrade: WeTrade offers an innovative digital platform that enables banks and businesses to work collaboratively across Europe offering secure, transparent and opportunities.

#2. Supply Chain Management
The Problem: Supply Chain Management refers to the planning and execution of all related processes leading to the deployment of a finished product. Generally, it constitutes a network of entities – individuals or businesses that start from raw material suppliers, straight to the product manufacturers, and then down to the distributors.

A well-optimized supply chain ensures maximum productivity with reduced fraudulent activity and overhead costs. As you can imagine, implementing this in the real world is a real hectic job. Automation efforts have been made using AI and Machine Learning, but Blockchain promises to be a game-changer in this area.

How Blockchain Solves The Problem: One of the key benefits that blockchain brings to Supply Chain Management would be interoperability. 

The transparency in data sharing makes sure that everyone is on the same page – starting from the manufacturers to retailers, vendors, and even the contractors. In turn, this helps to reduce any conflict and delay in operations. 

Furthermore, since all the products can be tracked in real-time, it reduces the risks of misplacement or goods getting stuck in the supply chain.

And if that’s not all, Blockchain offers scalability at unimaginable levels with large databases being available from multiple locations throughout the world. This means no matter how big your business is or how spread across the globe it is, using Blockchain you will be able to manage your supply chain effortlessly.

Who Are Currently Using Blockchain For This Purpose: A few examples of companies using Blockchain for efficient supply chain management are: 

Origintrail: They offer a data exchange protocol that can be used by interconnected supply chains.-

Openport: A Blockchain platform that directly connects shippers and carriers which helps to reduce cost and optimize supply chain management.

Walmart: Walmart, one of the biggest retail shops are utilizing blockchain to improve its supply chain.

#3. Accountability Issues With Traditional Contracts and Agreements
The Problem: At its core, we create contracts and agreements because there is a lack of trust amongst the transacting parties. As a result, we go through this legal procedure of creating contracts which is a multi-step process that involves even more parties and tons and tons of paperwork.

As a result, a lot of time, as well as money, is spent on the intermediaries. Just imagine the last time you created a contract and how much money you had to pay your lawyer for creating all those regulatory paperwork, or how much time you spent driving up and downtown to gather all the signatures. 

Even though we take this as the norm and a part of creating contracts and agreements, all these inconveniences can be avoided by leveraging blockchain technology, specifically smart contracts.

How Blockchain Solves The Problem: Well, blockchains allow for something known as Smart Contracts, an ingenious solution and future replacement for traditional contracts and agreements. So the next obvious question would be what is a smart contract?

Well, a smart contract is basically a few lines of codes that you can store on a Blockchain. These are programmed to execute certain actions – ideally process a transaction, as soon as the terms and conditions specified in the lines of code are met.

Now, since the smart contracts are stored on Blockchain, the terms and conditions can’t be altered or manipulated. Furthermore, everything is open and publicly available allowing for greater transparency.

Who Are Currently Using Blockchain For This Purpose: There are tons of startups and companies that have already adopted smart contracts in exchange for traditional agreements. Here are a few notable mentions:

Tradelanse: It helps digitize the supply chain by easing agreements and traditional contracts.

Tradeix: Tradeix is rewriting working capital finance and trade using blockchain. They provide value for alternative funders banks, value-added providers and so on!

#4. Identity Theft 
The Problem: At its core, your identity is nothing more than a collection of claims regarding you as a person. This includes data on where you live, your passport number, driving license, social security number, and so on. All these are data points that are used by governments and stored in centralized databases.

Potentially, a bad actor can get hold of one of these documents, and exploiting certain security flaws steals your identity. They can now use your identity to gain some financial advantage or obtain credit in your name. This is a serious problem! In fact, many criminals also steal a dead person’s identity to commit crimes and get away with it.

How Blockchain Solves The Problem: Blockchain offers a novel solution to the problem. In a decentralized platform, you get access to a private key and a public key. The public key is made available to the public. 

And because of the open transparent nature of Blockchain, everyone can access your public records. However, it offers concrete security as no one can change or edit your data.

Now in case, you want to access your personal data or provide authorization, you can use your private key to verify your identity. It is a simple method but provides a lot of security over restricted identity theft as it is carried out today.

Who Are Currently Using Blockchain For This Purpose: A ton of new Blockchain startups have popped up revolving around identity management. Here a few notable ones:

Validate ID: The company uses Blockchain technology to provide digital identity solutions including a comprehensive electronic signature service. Their service strives on providing simple and cost-effective services that also offer high-class security.

NewBanking: NewBanking allows users to share their identities over the web without worrying about losing or sacrificing their sensitive data.

Sovrin: Sovrin is offering the world’s first self-sovereign identity(SSI) network. 

Uport: Uport lets the business build a trusted ecosystem and offer the customers and partners a way to transact securely. 

#5. Managing And Protecting Patient Data in Health Care Organizations
The Problem: The current healthcare systems use centralized systems to record and manage patient data. These can be less secure and subject to misinformation. 

There have been numerous cases of data breaches in hospitals where patient data like credit card information and genomic testing records were stolen. In fact, between the span of 2009 to 2017, over 176 million patient records were compromised because of data breaches. 

Furthermore, the current state of interhospital communication of patient data is a complete mess. Many times patients choose to switch hospitals. Sometimes, because of emergencies, they are admitted to hospitals in a different network. 

Now, since the current system doesn’t facilitate quick and easy exchange of patient records from their primary care provider, they are now forced to create a new medical record, which is a loss of time as well as money.

How Blockchain Solves The Problem: Blockchain can help create a decentralized log of patient data that is transparent and public for all hospitals to access. Furthermore, there is no way to corrupt the data, so the entire problem of interhospital communication is resolved.

Next comes security. Despite being transparent and public, Blockchain can also help keep your data private by concealing your identity with secure codes that will protect all your sensitive data. If and even necessary, you need to provide a private key, and only then will the information be accessible.

Who Are Currently Using Blockchain For This Purpose: There are tons of companies adopting blockchain in the health sector to provide better management and security for patient data. Here are a couple of notable names:

BurstIQ: The company provides Blockchain solutions to help healthcare companies manage massive amounts of patient data, securely and safely.

MedicalChain: Helps maintain the integrity of health records. Doctors, hospitals and laboratories can request patient information, but the patient identity remains safe and protected from outside sources.
## Question 3:
## What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?
Features of Blockchain:

Data stored in blockchain is immutable and cannot be changed easily as explained above. Also the data is added to the block after it is approved by everyone in the network and thus allowing secure transactions. Those who validate the transactions and add them in block are called miners.
Blockchain is Decentralized as well as an open ledger. Ledger is the record of the transactions done and because it is visible to everyone, therefore is called an open ledger. No individual or any organisation is incharge of the transactions. Each and every connection in the blockchain network has a same copy of the ledger.


Blockchain is Decentralized network i.e., it has no central authority to control the network as there is in the client server model.

Blockchain provide a peer to peer network. This characteristic of blockchain allows the transactions to involve only two parties, the sender and the receiver. Thus it removes the requirement of ‘third party authorisation’ because everyone in the network is themselves able to authorise the transactions.

For instance, if I am sending some money from US to my friend in India through bank, then the bank will be the trusted third party. First it will verify the transaction and then may cut some charges for the transaction. Hence the blockchain comes into sight. It aims at removing trusted third party so as to makes the transaction fast and cheap.
